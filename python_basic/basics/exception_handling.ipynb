    "# Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the normal flow of the application. It allows a program to deal with unexpected situations gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exception**: An event that disrupts the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "- **Try Block**: Code that might throw an exception is placed inside the try block.\n",
    "- **Except Block**: Code that handles the exception is placed inside the except block.\n",
    "- **Finally Block**: Code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "- **Raise Statement**: Used to manually raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may cause an exception\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code that will always execute\n",
    "    print(\"Execution completed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when division by zero occurs.\n",
    "- `IndexError`: Raised when accessing an invalid index in a list.\n",
    "- `KeyError`: Raised when accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary.\n",
    "- `ValueError`: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use specific exceptions rather than a generic `except` block.\n",
    "- Clean up resources in the `finally` block.\n",
    "- Avoid using exceptions for control flow.\n",
    "- Provide meaningful error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is crucial for building robust and user-friendly applications."

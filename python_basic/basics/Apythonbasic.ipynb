    "## Basic Variable Concepts in Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Variable?\n",
    "A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. It acts as a container for data that can be changed during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Naming Rules\n",
    "1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).\n",
    "2. The name can contain letters, digits, and underscores.\n",
    "3. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., `age` and `Age` are different variables).\n",
    "4. Reserved words (keywords) cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assigning Values to Variables\n",
    "In Python, the assignment operator `=` is used to assign values to variables. The syntax is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Variables in This Notebook\n",
    "- **age**: An integer variable with a value of 20.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    age = 20\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **name**: A string variable with a value of 'naman'.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    name = \"naman\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types of Variables\n",
    "Variables can store data of different types. Some common data types in Python include:\n",
    "- **int**: Integer numbers (e.g., `20`)\n",
    "- **float**: Floating-point numbers (e.g., `20.5`)\n",
    "- **str**: Strings (e.g., `\"naman\"`)\n",
    "- **bool**: Boolean values (e.g., `True` or `False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing Variable Values\n",
    "You can change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"name\"\n",
    "name = \"naman\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the variable `name` initially holds the value `\"name\"`, but it is later changed to `\"naman\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Printing Variable Values\n",
    "You can print the value of a variable using the `print()` function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(name)\n",
    "print(age)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Variables are fundamental to programming as they allow you to store and manipulate data. Understanding how to create, name, and use variables is essential for writing effective Python code.\n",

    "## Detailed Notes on Data Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In Python, data types are used to classify the type of data that a variable can hold. Understanding data types is crucial for writing efficient and error-free code. Here are the basic data types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Integer (`int`)\n",
    "- **Description**: Represents whole numbers without a fractional part.\n",
    "- **Example**: `age = 20`\n",
    "- **Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, etc.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used for counting, indexing, and any scenario where whole numbers are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Floating-Point (`float`)\n",
    "- **Description**: Represents numbers with a fractional part.\n",
    "- **Example**: `weight = 70.5`\n",
    "- **Operations**: Similar to integers but includes operations with decimal points.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used for measurements, calculations requiring precision, and scientific computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. String (`str`)\n",
    "- **Description**: Represents a sequence of characters.\n",
    "- **Example**: `city = \"New York\"`\n",
    "- **Operations**: Concatenation, slicing, indexing, formatting, etc.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used for text manipulation, storing names, addresses, and any data that requires textual representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Boolean (`bool`)\n",
    "- **Description**: Represents one of two values: `True` or `False`.\n",
    "- **Example**: `is_student = True`\n",
    "- **Operations**: Logical operations like AND, OR, NOT.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used for conditional statements, flags, and any scenario requiring binary decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. List (`list`)\n",
    "- **Description**: Ordered, mutable collection of items.\n",
    "- **Example**: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, \"apple\", \"banana\"]`\n",
    "- **Operations**: Indexing, slicing, appending, removing, etc.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used for storing collections of related items, such as a list of numbers, strings, or mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Tuple (`tuple`)\n",
    "- **Description**: Ordered, immutable collection of items.\n",
    "- **Example**: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, \"apple\", \"banana\")`\n",
    "- **Operations**: Indexing, slicing (but not modifying).\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates, or any data that should not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Dictionary (`dict`)\n",
    "- **Description**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.\n",
    "- **Example**: `my_dict = {\"name\": \"naman\", \"age\": 20}`\n",
    "- **Operations**: Accessing, adding, removing key-value pairs.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used for mapping relationships, such as storing user information, configurations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Set (`set`)\n",
    "- **Description**: Unordered collection of unique items.\n",
    "- **Example**: `my_set = {1, 2, 3, \"apple\", \"banana\"}`\n",
    "- **Operations**: Adding, removing items, set operations like union, intersection.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used for storing unique items, eliminating duplicates, and performing set operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Understanding these basic data types is essential for effective programming in Python. Each data type serves a specific purpose and choosing the right data type for your variables can lead to more efficient and readable code.\n",

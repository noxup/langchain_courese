    "# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Class (Parent Class)**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited.\n",
    "- **Derived Class (Child Class)**: The class that inherits from the base class.\n",
    "- **Single Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from one base class.\n",
    "- **Multiple Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from more than one base class (not supported in all languages).\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.\n",
    "- **Multilevel Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from another derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Reuse existing code without modification.\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: Extend the functionality of existing classes.\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overriding**: Derived classes can override methods of the base class.\n",
    "- **Access Modifiers**: Control the visibility of class members (e.g., private, protected, public).\n",
    "- **Diamond Problem**: In multiple inheritance, ambiguity can arise if two base classes have a method with the same name."

    "- **Types of Polymorphism**:\n",
    "    - **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)**: Achieved through method overloading or operator overloading.\n",

    "- **Method Overloading**: Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.\n",

    "## Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming\n",

    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that restricts direct access to an object's data and methods. It is achieved by bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Encapsulation helps to protect the internal state of an object and ensures that it can only be modified in controlled ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",

    "    - **Private**: Attributes and methods that are only accessible within the class itself.\n",
    "    - **Protected**: Attributes and methods that are accessible within the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "    - **Public**: Attributes and methods that are accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "- **Getter and Setter Methods**: Encapsulation often involves using getter and setter methods to access and modify private attributes. This provides a controlled way to interact with the object's data.\n",
